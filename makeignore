#
# content of this file will be ignored in Makefile
#
# THE PROBLEM:
#     my Makefile generates targets based on source files.
#     sometimes i just want to work on some experiments or
#     have files which are in WIP for a longer time.
#     during such periods i still want to be able to publish
#     my site with a simple:
#         '$ make clean && make && ./tools/scp.sh'
#     in short, make should only generate files i really want.
#
# THE IDEAS:
#     1. keep track of files i really want.
#        downside is, that i have to clutter a file (or my
#        Makefile) with lots of entries and update it every
#        time i want to add something (blog post, etc.)
#        upside is, it may be safer and more clear and
#        prevents mis-publishing of unwanted files.
#     2. keep track of files i don't want.
#        up- and downsides are vice versa of idea 1.
#
# THE DECISION:
#     makeignore. (this file).
#     why?
#     1. just because it was my first idea (even if i
#        numbered it 2.) and i want to "implement" it.
#     2. right now it seems easier and less work to add this
#        feature than to rewrite the entire Makefile.
#     3. i am lazy, see 2.
#
# NOT TO SELF:
#     don't stick to this decision if it turns out to be
#     a bad idea or impractically.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
#     lines starting with # are ignored (treated as comment).
#     blank lines will be ignored as well.
#     lines with content will be passed as the pattern to the
#     function 'filter-out', for "every" "generated" list
#     in the Makefile.
#     for details about 'filter-out' see:
#       https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Text-Functions.html#index-filter_002dout
#
# INSIDE THE MAKEFILE:
#     # get the pattern list from 'makeignore'
#     # exclude (-v) the extended regex (-E)
#     # '^\s*#'  lines starting with an optional sequence of
#     #          spaces followed by a '#'
#     # '^\s*'   lines containing only spaces or nothing
#     # '^\s*#|^\s*$' escaped for $(shell ..) in make
#     #    -->  '^\s*\#|^\s*$$'
#     #         # -> \#   (make comment marker)
#     #         $ -> $$   (make variable)
#     IGNORE := $(shell grep -vE '^\s*\#|^\s*$$' makeignore)
#
#     # remove elements to ignore from LIST
#     LIST   := $(filter-out $(IGNORE),$(LIST))
